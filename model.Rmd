We used data from the 2016 ACS for Puerto Rico to examine wage gaps between individuals with different education levels. Our research questions are:
1) How do earnings vary by education level?
2) How does the premium for education vary by gender?
The 2016 ACS is a nationally representative sample of `r nrow(ss16ppr)`. The household survey includes questions pertaining to each household member’s demographic characteristics and labor market activity. 

We restrict our sample to these three racial groups: White, Black and Other. In addition, given our goal of examining earning differences by gender and marital status and the reporting of earnings in the ACS on an annual basis (wages, salary, commissions, bonuses, tips, and self-employment income during the past 12 months), we restrict our sample to full-time year-round (FTYR) workers. We define FTYR workers as individuals who report positive earnings over the past year, who worked at least 40 of the past 52 weeks, and who worked at least 35 hours per week in a usual work week over this period. 

## EDA Insights: 

For our exploratory analysis we looked at population breakdowns by education, age,  marital status, gender, race, earnings, and work hours. We applied filters on education (HS diploma or above), age (18-64), and work hours (>35/week). 

An earnings histogram identified a default maximum amount of earnings (189k) which we also filtered out of the data. The earning distribution is progressive above the median, but drops off sharply below the median, likely indicating the presence of a minimum wage. The correlation between age and earnings is very weak (.23). Likewise, earnings is very weakly correlated with hours worked among those who work more than 35 hours per week. However, white individuals appear to have an earnings premium over other races, and both married and divorced individuals appear to have an earnings premium over those who have never been married. Given that the correlation between age and earnings was weak, this may be due to other qualitative factors possessed by those who get married.  Married was recategoried to married, divorced and never married.  Men also appear to earn a small premium over women.

The age distribution of full time workers is skewed towards older adults, possibly indicating that younger workers have trouble finding full-time work, wait to enter the workforce, or are leaving the territory.



## Preliminary Econometric Estimates

### First Model:

$Earning = \beta_0 + Divorced * \beta_1 + NeverMarried * \beta_2 + Female * \beta_3 + RaceBlack * \beta_4 + RaceOther * \beta_5 +$ 

$SomeCollege * \beta_6 + Associate * \beta_7 + Bachelor * \beta_8 + Master * \beta_9 + Professional * \beta_10 + Doctoral * \beta_11 + Age * \beta_12$

```{r}
model_1 <- lm(PERNP ~ Divorced + NeverMarried + Female + RaceBlack + RaceOther + SomeCollege + Associate + Bachelor + Master + Professional + Doctoral + AGEP, data = ss16ppr)
summary(model_1)
plot_model(model_1, type = "diag")



model_1 <- lm(log(PERNP) ~ Divorced + NeverMarried + Female + RaceBlack + RaceOther + SomeCollege + Associate + Bachelor + Master + Professional + Doctoral + AGEP, data = ss16ppr)
summary(model_1)
plot_model(model_1, type = "diag")
```



+ Coefficients Explanation 
    + Holding gender, race, education and age constant, married or widowed people makes $`r abs(round(model_1$coefficients["Divorced"], 2))` more than people who divorced or separated on average.
    + Holding gender, race, education and age constant, married or widowed people makes $`r abs(round(model_1$coefficients["NeverMarried"], 2))` more than people who never married on average.
    + Holding marriage, race, education and age constant, male makes $`r abs(round(model_1$coefficients["Female"], 2))` more than female on average.
    + Holding marriage, gender, education and age constant, White makes $`r abs(round(model_1$coefficients["RaceBlack"], 2))` more than Black on average.
    + Holding marriage, gender, education and age constant, White makes $`r abs(round(model_1$coefficients["RaceOther"], 2))` more than Other race on average.
    + Holding marriage, gender, race and age constant, people have high school education makes $`r abs(round(model_1$coefficients["SomeCollege"], 2))` less than people have some college education on average.
    + Holding marriage, gender, race and age constant, people have high school education makes $`r abs(round(model_1$coefficients["Associate"], 2))` less than people have associate education on average.
    + Holding marriage, gender, race and age constant, people have high school education makes $`r abs(round(model_1$coefficients["Bachelor"], 2))` less than people have bachelor’s degree on average.
    + Holding marriage, gender, race and age constant, people have high school education makes $`r abs(round(model_1$coefficients["Master"], 2))` less than people have master’s degree on average.
    + Holding marriage, gender, race and age constant, people have high school education makes $`r abs(round(model_1$coefficients["Professional"], 2))` less than people have Professional education on average.
    + Holding marriage, gender, race and age constant, people have high school education makes $`r abs(round(model_1$coefficients["Doctoral"], 2))` less than people have doctor’s degree on average.
    + Holding marriage, gender, race and education constant, people make $`r abs(round(model_1$coefficients["AGEP"], 2))` more as age increases on average between the age of 18 to 64.
